1. For each of the test image provided in advanced_tests/, which images are not recognized correctly?

sans_serif_5.bmp, serif_8.bmp, and serif_5.bmp are not recognized correctly.


2. For each test image listed in the previous question, What is the difference in "digit distances" between the recognized digit and the digit it is supposed to be (e.g. if a digit 3 is recognized as 8, and 3 has a "digit distance" of 10 while 8 has a "digit distance" of 20, then difference in distances is 20 - 10 = 10).

The digit differences for the above files are 8969982, 6116396, and 9216499, respectively.





3. Give a one to two sentence explanation on why you think the images mentioned above are recognized incorrectly.
