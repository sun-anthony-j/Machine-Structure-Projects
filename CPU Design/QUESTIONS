PROJECT 4 WRITE-UP
------------------

1) Briefly explain how you implemented comparison queries and how they affected your control block's signals (in a few sentences).

ANSWER
The CR register consists of 2 bits. The most significant bit represents a greater than (0b10), the least significant bit represents equal to (0b01). A less than result is represented by 0b00. The ?CQ bits are used as control bits for a mux that selects from the appropriate logic that processes the output from the CR register.

2) Please list your control block's control signals, and briefly explain what each one does (in a sentence or less each).

ANSWER
op=14- if 1, will override default write reg (%RD) and writeval (ALUout) to %ra and RI
type- represents the instructions A1(0)/A2(1)/A3(2) type; used to select proper RI bit length and trigger the proper comparison datapath
write?- control bit that allows register writing
memRead?- control bit that causes memory to be loaded into a register when 1
memWrite?- control bit that causes memory to be written to when 1
write reg- final write register target



3) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you like?

ANSWER
It makes efficient use of instruction bits.
Immediate operations having the same opcode is convenient.


4) What features (if any) of this assembly language do you not like?

ANSWER

Comparison query on any instruction seems redundant. I think it would be possible to only have comparison queries on jump instructions.
